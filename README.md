# HiddenOpenings

**Status:** In Development
**Tech Stack:** Spring Boot | React | PostgreSQL

HiddenOpenings is a full-stack job aggregator platform designed to solve a common problem for job seekers: discovering job postings that are only available on company career pages. This application automatically scrapes and centralizes these "hidden" opportunities into a single, searchable, and user-friendly interface.

The core mission is to provide a clean, fast, and comprehensive source of job listings that are often missed by larger job boards, giving users a competitive edge in their job search.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Automated Job Scraping**: A robust Python-based scraping layer automatically pulls job data from target company websites.
* **Centralized Job Board**: All aggregated jobs are displayed in a clean, modern, and responsive user interface built with React.
* **Scalable Scraper Framework**: Easily add new companies to the scraping list by creating a new scraper class, without modifying core logic.
* **Powerful Search**: Instantly search across thousands of job titles with a live keyword search.
* **Efficient Pagination**: A paginated API ensures the application remains fast and responsive, even with a large number of job listings.
* **Expired Job Handling**: Jobs no longer present on the source website are intelligently marked as "Expired," ensuring data freshness.
